Script Name: SEQ-INDP_DEPLETED_Motifs-1.24.20.py
Author: Eric R Gann

Description: This script takes multiple inputs to separate the genome into fragments in between sites of methylation. 
It uses the gene coding table from NCBI to determine whether the fragment has a coding sequence in it or is part of a coding sequence. 
The file returns rows where each is the new fragment with columns that tell you the start and end position of the fragment, its length, 
as well as the number of coding sequences that begin inside / out side the contig. Also, genes surrounding the fragment or fall completely 
within the contig are stated. The total number of coding sequences influenced by the fragment is recorded. 
All input files must be in the same folder you are executing the script out of, or the path must be included in the file name. 
For python 2.7 you must submit all answers surrounded by quotations.

Input required: There are four inputs required from the user. They are: 

1. 'What is the file name with methylation motif and position?'
This file tells the position of each methylation site. Each position is on a new line and has the following format: 
chrX start_position end_position length
(Input Ex: CATG_PBCV1.txt or "CATG_PBCV1.txt")

2. 'What is the name of the genome file?'
This is the sequence of the genome in a .fasta format that can be downloaded from NCBI.
(Input Ex: PBCV1.fasta or "PBCV1.fasta")

3. 'What is the name of the gene annotation table from NCBI?'
These are the positions of all coding sequences in a gene annotation table from NCBI.
(Input Ex: PBCV1_gene_table.txt or "PBCV1_gene_table.txt") 

4. 'What is the name of the output file?'
This is the output file. This file saves as tab delimited, so it should be saved as a .txt.
(Input Ex: result.txt or "result.txt") *Be careful about naming an existing file; it will erase this and replace it with your new output file with no warning.
