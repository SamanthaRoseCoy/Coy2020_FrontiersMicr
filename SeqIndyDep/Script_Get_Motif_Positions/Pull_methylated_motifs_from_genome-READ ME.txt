Description: This script pulls out the methylated position from a user specified motif in a genome and records all of those positions in an output file. 
All input files must be in the same folder you are executing the script out of, or th path must be included in the file name. 
For python 2.7 you must submit all answers surrounded by quotations.

User inputs:
1. 'What is the genome file?'
This is the genome in a .fasta file that can be downloaded from NCBI. (Input Ex: PBCV1.fasta or "PBCV1.fasta")

2. 'What is the motif you are searching for?'
Enter the motif you are looking for. (Input Ex: GATC or "GATC")

3. 'What position is methylated? (the first position is 0 not 1!)'
This is the position in the motif that is methylated. The first position in python is 0 not 1. As an example, 
for GATC, the A is methylated, the user would specify by entering: 1 or "1"

4. 'What is your output file?'
This is the output file. The output is each position on a new line. This should be a .txt file. (Input Ex: GATC_results.txt or "GATC_results.txt")
*Be careful about naming an existing file; it will erase this and replace it with your new output file with no warning.
